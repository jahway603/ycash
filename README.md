# Ycash v4.4.2

## Getting Started

Ycash is a digital currency. For more information, see https://y.cash.

For a comparison of Ycash to Bitcoin, see https://y.cash/fact-sheet.

This software is the Ycash node. It downloads and stores the entire history
of Ycash transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

**Ycash is experimental and a work-in-progress.** Use at your own risk.


Ycash is a chain fork of Zcash. For most topics, you can rely on Zcash-related documentation, including the [user guide for zcashd](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/zcashd.html).
