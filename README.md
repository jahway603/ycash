What is Ycash?
--------------

[Ycash](https://www.ycash.xyz) is a chain fork of [Zcash](https://z.cash/).

This software is the Ycash client. It downloads and stores the entire history
of Ycash transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network
connection, the synchronization process could take a day or more once the
blockchain has reached a significant size.

#### :lock: Security Warnings

(Coming soon)

**Ycash is experimental and a work-in-progress.** Use at your own risk.

####  :ledger: Deprecation Policy

This release is considered deprecated 16 weeks after the release day. There
is an automatic deprecation shutdown feature which will halt the node some
time after this 16-week period. The automatic feature is based on block
height.
